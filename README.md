# Quercus
*Quercus* is a child theme of [UrbanNews](http://interi.org/go/urbannews/), customized for [Oakland Local](http://oaklandlocal.com).

## Changes

The normal theme has an option to set a javascipt code to be loaded to serve an advertisement. Oakland Local serves its own advertisements, in addition to using ad networks. This theme registers a new widget area, and replaces the default header option so it loads next to the logo instead of the theme option.
