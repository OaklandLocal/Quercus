# Quercus
*Quercus* is a child theme of [UrbanNews](http://interi.org/go/urbannews/), customized for [Oakland Local](http://oaklandlocal.com).

## Changes

The normal theme has an option to set a javascipt code to be loaded to serve an advertisement. Oakland Local serves its own advertisements, in addition to using ad networks. This theme registers a new widget area, and replaces the default header option so it loads next to the logo instead of the theme option.

We include the [Meta Box plugin](http://www.deluxeblogtips.com/meta-box/), since it is included in UrbanNews and is coded from that theme's directory, so when the ```functions.php``` loads it looks for it in our child theme. Perhaps there is a more elegant way to handle this. The author has been contacted with a fix suggestion.
